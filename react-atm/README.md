Let's make an ATM app! You will practice the dark art of manipulating components in real time.  You will create two components of the same class which will work independently of each other.

Clone this repo, and run `npm install` from inside it. The repo already includes a partial React app. To launch the app, run `npm start`.

### In `src/App.js`:
1. Pass a `name` property to each `Account` component, one for "Checking", the other for "Savings".  These will be used and accessed as `props`for our component. **Remember**: Props are immutable, that is, once they are declared, they cannot be changed while the application is running.


### In `src/Account.js`

2. Use the property you set in `App.js` to add the name of the account to the `<h2>`.


    Save your work. You should see two components named Checking and Savings.  You're getting there!


3. Add a `balance` property to `state`, and set to 0 initially, in the Account component.

4. Set a `ref` property on the text field, which is a callback function to save a reference to that text field in our `Account` object. This is one way we can access the data in the field later when we want to know what values to add/subtract from our account. You can also try to figure out how to do it using the react [form](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html) way, which we will be going into depth alot more tomorrow, but if you get blocked go ahead and use the `ref`.


5. When the `Deposit` button is clicked, you should add the amount entered in the text field to the balance


6. When the `Withdraw` button is clicked, you should deduct the amount entered in the text field to the balance.  **You should not be able to withdraw more than the current balance**



7. If the current balance is 0, you should add a class of `zero` to the `<div className="balance">`. You can complete these computations in the render method, but before the JSX portion is returned.


#### Bonus: 
- Handling an edge case
    - As it stands, our app breaks if we hit Deposit or Withdraw on an empty form. Or if we put letters in there! How can we update our functionality to avoid this problem?
    - **hint:** Don't assume NaN behaves as you might expect :)
- Refactor the common code out of handleWithdrawlClick and handleDepositClick into a helper function or two.
- Create a Transfer form that can transfer funds from Checking to Savings, or Savings to Checking!
